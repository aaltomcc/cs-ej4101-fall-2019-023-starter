## This Course  
I decided to take this course because I am very interested in computer science.  
I have studied coding with Java for a year now and it has not been easy.  
In the future I would love to work in IT businees somehow, but maybe I must admit that I am not  
going to be a game programmer ever. Maybe I will become a Scrum Master.

My skills in computer science:
* Java
* Office 365
* AWS

What I wanted to learn from this course, I have achieved. I wanted to know the
basics of DevOps. The videos and the tutorials have been really good. By taking this course, I will 
also get some advantage in my work practice which will begin next February.
Today I work as dairy farmer but that is not going to be my last profession.  
Our farm will soon be sold to a younger generation and it is my responsibility to  
give way to the young couple. My dream is to get a job in some modern IT company.
I have a lot of experience as an entrepreneur, from customer service and many things more.

Here is a list of my work history:
* cattle manager
* rural consultant
* secretary in the departement of agriculture

I have really enjoyed the easiness of taking courses through the FiTech-programme. They 
have so many interesting courses available, it is so hard to choose from those.
I also started the Python programming course in the University of Oulu. That one I have not 
finished yet. 

## Learning

* DevOps videos
  * the idea of DevOps
  * Lean methods
  * automation
  
  
* GitHub
  * starting my first repository
  * creating the website
  * learning Markdown
 
The beginning of this course was quite slow. I had many other courses going on at the same time.  
But once I got the hang of those excellent videos online, I did not want to stop. I hope I get
the chance to continue my studies in this area of system development and agile methods. 

Best thing about this course has been the GitHub. I knew about it before, but I had no idea of what to do with it.
Now, I think I will produce something of my own there also. Maybe a website for my farm or maybe I will jsut introduce myself
to my future employers. A virtual CV and many things I have done in Java could be shown here too.

Studying IT skills has been made very easy nowadays. Everyone who has a laptop can access multiple online web academies for free
and start learning how to code or how to make ones own application. That is becoming a very important way of express oneself.
I would love to have a classroom full of people around me but since I work at home and I happen to live in a rural area, 
my studies also happen at home. I have to settle for this and try to keep my social networks alive though the web.
